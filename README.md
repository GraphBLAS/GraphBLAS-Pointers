### Books

* [Graph Algorithms in the Language of Linear Algebra](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/book/10.1137/1.9780898719918) (SIAM, 2011) by Jeremy Kepner and John R. Gilbert
    * This is the best reference on the topic of linear algebra-based graph processing. However, note that GraphBLAS effort was not yet started when this book was written. Therefore, there are some differences between the notation of GraphBLAS documents and the one used in this book.
* [Mathematics of Big Data: Spreadsheets, Databases, Matrices, and Graphs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/mathematics-big-data) (MIT Press, 2018) by Jeremy Kepner and Hayden Jananthan
    * An updated version of paper [Mathematical Foundations of the GraphBLAS](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~aydin/GraphBLAS-Math.pdf) is reprinted in this book (Chapter 6, p81-113)
    * This book is currently the latest detailed reference on semiring-based computations, including graph algorithms. It also covers many other topics such as associative arrays. The book is not intended to be a GraphBLAS reference, but it can be used for providing a background in linear algebra (see e.g. Chapter 8, "Visualizing the Algebra of Associative Arrays").
* [Path Problems in Networks](https://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/abs/10.2200/S00245ED1V01Y201001CNT003) (Morgan & Claypool Publishers, 2010) by John S. Baras and George Theodorakopoulos.    
    * This book is about the algebraic path problem – a semiring-based generalization of shortest path problem. The mathematical foundations of semiring-based graph analysis are described. Basic ideas to create new semirings to solve new problems are described.
    * The section 3.1 "Alternative viewpoints: paths and matrices" (p17-19) provides a matrix-based framework for the algebraic path problem which is highly relevant to GraphBLAS.
    * The table on pages 58-59 contains 29 different semirings and respective applied problems.
